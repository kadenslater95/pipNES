# pipNES
NES Game using what I learned from following the Nerdy Nights NES Tutorial Series. This is really more of an NES Programming Project than a game so there isn't much to it. Pip is the name of my hedgehog, which is the Sprite that you control in the game.

You can run the game in any emulator with the precompiled `pip.nes` file, just load that `ROM` in the emulator. I normally use FCEUX. 

It is written with the ca65 assembler and cl65 linker, so if you want to modify it you will need to install those.
